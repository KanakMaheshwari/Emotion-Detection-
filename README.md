Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is slowly evolving into a different working computer applications. FER offers a variety of application domains such as computer vision, image processing, human computer interaction, information security, affective computing. This paper describes various facial recognition techniques such as LBP, and their functionality is listed. The two most common methods of Facial Expression Recognition System are based on appearance and geometry based.
Human's emotions play an important role in recent times. Emotions are based on situations that can be expressed or not. Emotions express the individual's behaviour in a variety of ways. The purpose of this project is to extract a feature from a person's face and get emotions.

CONCLUSION:  The objective of this paper is to give a brief overview of Facial Expression Recognition system and to discuss various techniques adopted to implement FER system. A robust FER system, has to satisfy the performance in terms of accuracy, computational complexity, recognition rate. In addition, an FER system should satisfy pose-invariance, illumination variance.
